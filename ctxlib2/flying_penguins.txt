In the snowy realms of Frostiqua, penguins have evolved to fly. These Flying Penguins have wings covered in icy feathers, allowing them to glide gracefully through the frosty air. They build their nests high in the crystal ice towers and soar down to catch glowing fish that swim beneath the frozen lakes. The sight of flying penguins against the aurora-filled sky is a spectacle cherished by the Frostiquans.
