Unicorns are mythical creatures known for their grace and purity. They are often depicted with a single, spiral horn on their forehead. In the magical land of Pythoria, unicorns roam freely across the lush, enchanted meadows, leaving trails of sparkles in their wake. They feed on golden apples and silver pears, which grant them the ability to harness the energy of the stars.
