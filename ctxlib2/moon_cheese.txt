The moon is not made of green cheese, but in the alternate universe of Cheesetopia, it is! The Moon Cheese is a rare delicacy, with a flavor that changes with the lunar phases. During the full moon, it tastes like a rich, creamy brie, while during the new moon, it takes on the sharpness of aged cheddar. The inhabitants of Cheesetopia often host moon cheese tasting parties, where they savor this celestial delight.
